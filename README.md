### Getting started

After installing the tools listed above, you can use the steps below to acquire a development version of SrbTransLatin.
This will download the latest dev version of SrbTransLatin, and while it is mostly stable, please do not use it in production environment.

Within your WordPress dev installation, go to `wp-content/plugins` and run the following commands
